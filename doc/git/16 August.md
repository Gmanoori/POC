- git remote add origin <github url> : Connects to remote repo
- git push --set-upstream origin <branch name> : links your local branch to the remote branch (origin)
  - Setting upstream allows Git to remember that your local master branch corresponds to origin/master.
  - This simplifies future push/pull operations.
- git pull origin <branch name> : Pulls changes from remote branch
